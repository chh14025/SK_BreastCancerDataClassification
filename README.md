# Breast Cancer Data Analysis
Using different classification tools from sklearn to analyze breast cancer image data from the sklearn library.

Goal: 
The purpose of this project is to practice ML classification tools such as SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and KNN by analyzing data from sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer. 

Tools Used:
Seaborn to generate pairplots,countplot,and heatmaps.
sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split to split the data into train and test samples
sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV to identify the best parameter for each model (if needed)
sklearn.metrics (confusion_matrix, accuracy_score) to identify the model with the highest acuracy.
